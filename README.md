# Knowledge Graph API  
### 📚 Bridging Humans & AI Through Structured Knowledge  

## 🚀 Overview  
The **Knowledge Graph API** is the **core infrastructure** of the Half-Brain, Half-Bot framework.  
It enables **bidirectional knowledge refinement** between AI and humans by maintaining, querying, and evolving structured **knowledge graphs**.  

This API serves as the **point of intersection** between:  
- **Human-in-the-Loop (AI → Meat-Brain)** → AI guides human learning via structured representations.  
- **AI-in-the-Loop (Meat-Brain → AI)** → Humans refine AI models by correcting hallucinations & enriching knowledge.  

By structuring **expert knowledge into dynamically evolving graphs**, we unlock **real-time hypothesis testing** and **exponential innovation**.

## 🔥 Why Does This Exist?  
Current AI models **hallucinate** because they lack:  
1. **A stable, structured foundation of knowledge**.  
2. **Feedback from domain experts to correct and refine**.  

Meanwhile, humans are:  
1. **Slow at digesting vast amounts of information**.  
2. **Prone to cognitive biases that distort learning**.  

The **Knowledge Graph API solves both problems** by:  
✅ Storing expert-validated, structured knowledge that AI can **use & refine**.  
✅ Giving humans a **graph-based UI** to **explore & correct** AI-generated insights.  
✅ Allowing **both sides to challenge each other**, ensuring models evolve in alignment with **empirical reality**.

## 🛠️ Core Features  

✅ **Graph-Based Storage** → Supports **Neo4j, ArangoDB**, and other **flexible knowledge graph databases**.  
✅ **Real-Time Graph Querying** → Extract structured relationships between **concepts, hypotheses, and facts**.  
✅ **Customizable Graph Forking** → Experts can **fork & edit** knowledge graphs to **test competing models**.  
✅ **Auto-Generated Graph Visualizations** → Browse knowledge structures via **interactive UI**.  
✅ **AI-Enhanced Reasoning** → AI suggests **hypotheses & contradictions** for experts to evaluate.  
✅ **API-First Design** → Seamless integration with **MeatMentor AI, Half-Brain, Half-Bot**, and external AI systems.
